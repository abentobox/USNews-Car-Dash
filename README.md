## Introduction
This Power BI dashboard contains score and price data for over 3,500 car, truck, and SUV model-years reviewed by the automotive journalists at [US News and World Report](http://cars.usnews.com). Journalists at US News have reviewed vehicle model-years since 2007, and as part of their reviews, assign scores to models in seven areas (Interior, Performance, Safety, Reliability, Total Cost of Ownership, Critics’ Rating, and Overall). This dashboard aggregates score data scraped from over 3,500 reviews and allows users to explore the data and extract insights to aid in their next car purchase. Price data, including MSRP, invoice price, and average used price, was collected from the US News and World Report’s Car Build tool. All data presented in this dashboard is property of US News and World Report. This tool is intended for personal use only.



## Process
Creation of the dashboard involved four primary steps: identifying the universe of car reviews available on the US News and World Report website, scraping all reviews using python's requests package, creating the dashboard in Power BI desktop, and sharing the dashboard using the Power BI service.



## Repo Contents
This repo contains the python code, input data files, and Power BI desktop file I used to create the dashboard.
