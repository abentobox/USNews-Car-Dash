## USNews Car Scores and Price Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard contains ratings and price data for over 3,500 car, truck, and SUV model-years reviewed by the staff at US News and World Report. Each model-year receives a rating in seven categories: Interior, Performance, Safety, Reliability, Total Cost of Ownership, Critics' Rating, and Overall. Data for all seven categories may not be available for some model-years, particularly for the oldest (2007) and newest (2021) model-years in the dataset. Pricing data, including MSRP, invoice price, and average used price was collected from the US News and World Report's Car Build tool. All data presented in this dashboard is property of US News and World Report. This tool is intended for personal use only.
